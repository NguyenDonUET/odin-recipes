    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This best-ever potato salad is the creamiest, richest potato salad you
      will ever try. The secret is in the homemade dressing. I get nothing but
      raves every time I make this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfect for family dinners or special occasions, this lasagna is both
      hearty and delicious. Serve it with a side salad and garlic bread for a
      complete Italian-inspired meal.
