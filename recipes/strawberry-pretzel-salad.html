    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups crushed pretzels</li>
      <li>¾ cup butter, melted</li>
      <li>4 ½ tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
      <li>
        Mix crushed pretzels, melted butter, and 4 ½ tablespoons sugar in a
        bowl. Press into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish to form a crust.
      </li>
      <li>Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then set aside to cool completely.</li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, beat softened cream cheese and 1 cup sugar until
        smooth. Fold in whipped topping.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the cream cheese mixture evenly over the cooled pretzel crust.
        Refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In another bowl, dissolve strawberry gelatin in boiling water. Stir in
        frozen strawberries until mixture thickens slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the strawberry mixture over the cream cheese layer. Refrigerate
        until fully set, at least 2 hours.
